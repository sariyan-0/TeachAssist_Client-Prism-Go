## 🧊 Why Prism Is Different

Other “TeachAssist apps” exist.

Some look flashy. Some promise everything. Some refresh slowly. Some break the moment TeachAssist changes one tiny thing.

Prism was built with one obsession: **correctness**.

• It reads directly from the official interface  
• It reflects what TeachAssist shows (no made‑up calculations)  
• If you see a number in Prism, it came from the real source

### 👀 About teacher concerns

Sometimes teachers say “don’t use TeachAssist apps.”

That concern usually comes from apps that scrape incorrectly, miscalculate, or show stale data.

Prism is different:

• Prism does **not** modify your data  
• Prism does **not** alter grades  
• Prism does **not** inject anything into the system  
• Prism is a **viewer + analyzer**, not a replacement

Accuracy and clarity are the priority.

## 👨‍💻 About the Developer

Hi, I’m Ari.

Prism started as a personal tool because I wanted more control over my own academic data.

Instead of waiting for better tools to exist, I built one.

I work primarily with Flutter and I’m obsessive about performance and UI polish.

This is not a corporate product.
It’s built independently, improved continuously, and shaped by real student feedback.

<hr/>

## 🧭 Roadmap

Android continues improving with deeper analytics and smarter AI.

iOS release unlocks at **500 downloads**.

Pico AI will expand.
Prediction tools will get even sharper.
